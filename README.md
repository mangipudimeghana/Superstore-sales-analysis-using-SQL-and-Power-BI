# Problem Statement

The problem addressed in this project is to analyze the sales data of a superstore and gain valuable insights to drive business decisions. The challenges include cleaning and transforming the raw data, performing exploratory analysis, and visualizing the findings in an intuitive and informative manner.

# Approach Used

The approach involves leveraging Python for data cleaning and transformation tasks. The dataset is cleaned and converted to a CSV file, which is then imported into a SQL database. SQL queries are utilized to extract relevant information and derive insights from the dataset. Power BI is used as the visualization tool to create interactive and visually appealing reports. This repository showcases the Superstore Sales Analysis project, which aims to analyze and visualize the sales data of a superstore. The project utilizes a combination of Python to clean the data, SQL to perform exploratory analysis and Power BI to create interactive reports.
